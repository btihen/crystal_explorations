== Structs

These are flexible immutable data types. Thus ideal for sending `safe` data between Fibers via Channels.

Here might be a Message struct that could be used within a chat system:



```
record Message, sender : User, text : String, topic : String = "", receiver : User? = nil

message = Message.new(bill, "Hi there")
# => Message(sender: "bill <bill@example.com", text: "Hi there", topic: "", receiver: nil)
```
