Exploring & Learning Crystal Language with code examples and augment the documentation.

.NOTE:
****
* The code is just good enough to demonstrate an idea.
* This code does not focus on best practices, security nor being production ready.
****

== Installation

On MacOS - use:
```bash
$ brew install crystal
```

For all other systems see: https://crystal-lang.org/install/

== link:crystal_cli.html[Crystal CLI]

* Useful commands when using crystal
* My most useful command while developing is:
```
crystal run src/file_name.cr
```

== Structs & Records

=== link:structs.html[Structs]

* Structs _(& Records)_ are immutable data structures - these are `safe` when used in a concurrent/parallel context.

=== link:records.html[Records]

* Structs _(& Records)_ are immutable data structures - these are `safe` when used in a concurrent/parallel context.

== Macros

* Crystal's answer to Meta-programming
* Using macros to reduce boiler-plate and build a simple **Actor Model**

== Design Patterns

=== Decorator

=== Fluent Interface

=== Value Objects (pass values with a context)

.TODO
****
Check if Crystal structs have built in value comparisons or if those need to be added to build a proper *Value Object*
****

== Concurrency & Parallelism

=== link:concurrency_basics.html[Concurrency Basics]

* Basics on starting processes concurrently

=== link:concurrent_objects.html[Concurrent Objects]

* Examples of using concurrency with objects

=== link:channels_async_messaging.html[Channels _(Async Messaging)_]

* Channels allow us to safely communicate between concurrent processes.
* To safely share data/state send immutable data only **(Structs are a good option)**.

=== link:channel_buffers.html[Channel Buffers]

* What to do when messages come faster than collected

NOTE: Share the smallest possible data structure - large data structures will be slow to copy.

=== link:channel_callbacks.html[Channel Callbacks]

* Safely share state information when its available

=== Parallelism

* Compiling to use multiple CPUs

=== Actor Model

* Using macros to build async message sending, callbacks and state sharing.

== TO-DOs

* Add Macros
* Write Channel Buffering
* Reseach Promises in Crystal
* Finish Callbacks & (Notification)
* Research/Add Crystal Value Objects
* Build a Macro to make a simple Actor Class
* Add Parallelism (Ideally with WebSockets example -- to extend `chat`)
* Add, review, augment and adapt content using: https://blog.golang.org/pipelines
