Exploring & Learning Crystal Language with code examples and augment the documentation.

NOTE: This code does not focus on best practices, security or production ready code. +
The code is just good enough to demonstrate what is happening.

== Crystal CLI

* get cli help
```bash
$ crystal -h
```

* generate a new app:
```bash
$ crystal init app project_name
$ cd project_name
```

```

* compile to executable and run:
```bash
$ crystal build src/file.cr
$ ./file
```

* compile and optimize build (for release into the wild):
```bash
$ crystal build --release src/file.cr -o new_name
$ ./new_name
```

* compile with Parallelism enabled (experimental) - https://crystal-lang.org/2019/09/06/parallelism-in-crystal.html
```bash
crystal build -Dpreview_mt code.cr -o code
$ ./code                   # defaul is 4 workers
$ CRYSTAL_WORKERS=2 ./code # uses two CPUS
$ CRYSTAL_WORKERS=4 ./code # same as default
