@plambert nope, with a NamedTuple you always have to supply all of the fields. Maybe you should think about using a record instead?

@watzon
```
record Foo, id : Int32, name : String? = nil

foo = Foo.new(32)
# => Foo(id: 32, name: nil)
```
@watzon ooh. how is a record different from a struct?

It's just a simplified syntax for creating a Struct with a default initializer
also defines getters and some ways to copy it

You can also do
```
record Foo, name : String, id : Int32 do
  def do_something
  end
end
```


@stnluu_twitter & @randiaz95 - I have two versions of using channels and fibers at: https://github.com/btihen/crystal_channels - It works pretty well. I next want to figure out how to create multiple TCP or windows (one for each user). I realized when doing the chat room - using one thread works well - but compiliing with multiple cores - outputting to one screen gets jumbled again. I'll happily learn more about multiple connections (I assume I need to use TCP sockets) - could I also use OS sockets?

who is doing the output to screen?
remember yesterday, we discussed about ideally, there's a "room" object that keeps track of all the users, and does the job of broadcasting the messageâ€“instead of each user keeping track of all the other users?
ideally, this "room" object should be the one doing the output to screen, aka only one fiber doing the output.
